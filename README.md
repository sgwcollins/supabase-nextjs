Supa Next JS authtenication
This project is a modern web application built using Next.js and Supabase. Supabase provides a fast, reliable, and secure backend for your application's data storage and user authentication needs.

Description
This application provides a smooth, server-side rendered user experience with Next.js, a popular framework based on React.js. For data storage and user authentication, we leverage Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative that provides user management, real-time databases, auto-generated APIs, and more.
